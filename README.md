# gl-examples

### A very bare-bones OpenGL project to demonstrate OpenGL 4.6 in Rust.

Uses the 'glfw' and 'gl' crates to allow direct overloading of the modern GL functions. When I first tried learning OpenGL with Rust, every example I could find either used higher-level abstracted crates like 'glutin' and 'glium' or were limited to OpenGL 3.3.

This example is meant to be a readable example of interfacing directly with OpenGL 4.6 from Rust and building safe wrappers for all of the external functions.
